This assignment consists in using data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, in particular the 
dataset “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set”, for making four requested plots.

Only data about household energy usage from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02 are considered. 
Four plots are made using the base plotting system and saved in PNG files (1 PNG file per plor) with a width of 
480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
The R code files used to make the four plots are also reported. In each of them the dataset is loaded.
